                You accuse Athena and you’re now standing in court, trying to
                prove that it’s the other one. “Do you think it’s believable she
                was with Ares or asleep all night? That is easily the weakest
                alibi I have heard”, Athena explains. “I was able to clear every
                God and Goddess, but not our dearest Aphrodite here.” “I don’t
                like having to accuse Aphrodite”, Athena continues. “But since I
                was able to clear everyone, Aphrodite’s cover story just seems
                the most unlikely to me”, she finishes. “And that is why I think
                that you should punish Hades for stealing the lightning. Thank
                you.” Now it’s my turn. “Now, I’m assuming you’ve interviewed
                everyone?” I ask Athena “Well, Ares’ alibi cannot be wildly
                different from mine, since we spent a lot of time together that
                night”, I defend myself. “Besides that, I myself, heard the
                noises of when the thief was there and Ares was there to witness
                that I am not the thief”, I look her in the eyes. “What I know
                about Athena, though”, I continue, feeling like a lawyer. “What
                I know about Athena, though, is that she lied in the interview
                we had.” I can hear several gasps. “Now, in our interview,
                Athena told me that she went to visit some Gods that day and
                could be cleared for the entire day…” I can feel the
                anticipation in the room. “ … but what I heard from another
                interview, Athena only checked in on them really quickly and
                cannot be accounted for, for more than a few minutes”, I finish.
                “And that very lie, is why I think we should punish Athena for
                stealing the lightning. Thank you.” <br><br>Congratulations! Thanks to
                your great detective skills, the Gods are on your side and
                Athena was punished for her crime!
